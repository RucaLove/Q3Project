  "description" : "Come into a wide standing position with the legs and feet turned out at a 45 degree angle and the arms at shoulder height. Activate by drawing the pelvic floor up and by drawing the lower abdomen back toward the spine, so that you sense a strong, stable core. As you exhale, bend the knees and allow the pelvis to descend downward without arching the low back. Bend the elbows at a 90 degree angle and point the forearms and hands straight up, with the fingers held together and the palms facing forward. Allow the crown of the head to lengthen upward and breathe along the line of energy from the tailbone to the crown.",
