Bring the hands into Prayer position, pressing the hands strongly against each other, draw the shoulders down away from the ears, and rotate the torso toward the right thigh.

Feel your shoulders draw away from your ears and widen across the front of your chest. Feel your lower back pressing into the earth. Create space between each and every vertebra on the back side of your lower spine.  On each inhale, feel your belly press against your thigh. On each exhale feel the belly with draw away from the thigh. Imagine that the outer edges of your shoulders move away from each other so that shoulders are equally wide on the front and the back side of the body. Feel your lower trapezius muscles engage, pulling your shoulder-blades down your back. Your gaze is soft as you look up toward the sky. Draw your pubic bone toward your belly button, lengthening your lower back. Place the least weight on the back of your head and no weight on your neck. Keep all the muscles of the extended leg and foot active and engaged. Relax the foot of your bent leg. Feel the massage of your internal organs on the bent leg side of the body.
